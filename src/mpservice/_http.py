    This function is intended for lauching a service that uses :mod:`mpservice.mpserver`.

    This function is adapted from ``uvicorn.main.run``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    app
        Usually `starlette.applications.Starlette <https://www.starlette.io/>`_ instance or the import string for such
        an instance, like ``'mypackage.mymodule:app'``. The module as named, `'mypackage.mymodule'`, must be able
        to be imported. If `app` is defined in a script (say `example.py`) that is in the current working directory,
        that is, if you type

            python example.py

        in the directory that contains `example.py`, then Python will be able to import that script.
        In that case, `app` can be written as `'example:app'`.

        If `workers > 1`, this must be a str, because a `Starlette` object cannot be pickled and sent
        to other processes.
    host
        The default ``'0.0.0.0'`` is suitable if the code runs within a Docker container.
    port
        Port.
    access_log
        Whether to let ``uvicorn`` emit access logs.
    backlog
        The default should be adequate. Don't make this large unless you know what you're doing.

        `uvicorn.Server.startup <https://github.com/encode/uvicorn/blob/master/uvicorn/server.py>`_
        passes this to AsyncIO ``loop.create_server`` (in
        `asyncio.base_events <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Lib/asyncio/base_events.py>`_,
        where default is 100), and in turn to
        `socket.socket.listen <https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.socket.listen>`_.

        ``uvicorn`` uses a large default value (2048). That might be misguided.

        See: https://bugs.python.org/issue38699, https://stackoverflow.com/a/2444491, https://stackoverflow.com/a/2444483,
    workers
        If ``1``, the server is launched in the current process/thread. If ``> 1``, this many processes
        are spawned, each running one copy of ``app`` independently.

        Note that worker processes are not dynamically created and killed according to need---this fixed
        number of processes are started and they remain active---this is in contrast to Gunicorn.
        This also makes our customization---placing ``UVICORN_WORKER_IDX`` in the environ---meaningful.
    worker_contexts
        If provided, this must be a list or tuple with as many as ``workers`` elements.
        The elements of ``worker_contexts`` will become the attribute ``worker_context`` of ``app``
        in the corresponding worker process (or the current process if ``workers=1``).

        This is mainly designed for passing config-style data to worker processes when ``workers > 1``.
        The ``app`` object is available to the "lifespan" of a ``Starlette`` object; user can obtain
        ``app.worker_context`` there and decide how to use it to initialize things, save it, as well
        as make it available to endpoint functions via the lifespan's "state". See tests for example usage.
    **kwargs
        Passed to ``uvicorn.Config``.
