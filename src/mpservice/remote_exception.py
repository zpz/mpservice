class RemoteException(Exception):
    '''
    This class is used to wrap a "regular" Exception object to add support
    for pickling the traceback (to some extent), so that when this object
    is passed from the originating process into another process and handled
    there, the printout (such as after being raised) contains useful traceback
    info.

    Example:

            try:
                a = 0 / 1
                return a
            except:
                return RemoteException()

        This is equivalent to

            try:
                a = 0 / 1
                return a
            except exception as e:
                return RemoteException(e)

        # In another process, this object, say `x`, is retrieved from a queue.
        # Then,

            if isinstance(x, RemoteException):
                raise x

    The printout looks as if the exception has occurred this way:

        raise RemoteException(...) from e

    where `e` is the original exception object as happened in the original
    process.

    One could `raise` this object in the original process (w/o any pickling).
    The printout is meaningful. However, this is not an intended use case.

    There are ways to make `RemoteException` unpickle to an object of the
    original exception type directly, and behave quite like the original
    object. However, there are scanarios where it is useful to recognize
    that an exception object is one from another process via the
    `RemoteException` mechanism. As a result, it's decided to keep the
    `RemoteException` class in both originating and receiving processes,
    and make it behave differently from the original class in a few places.

    To get the original exception object, reach for the `exc_value` attribute.

    Efforts are made to support pickling; a pair of`to_dict/from_dict` methods
    further enable using other serializations.
    One peculiar case is that the producing environment used a custom
    exception class that is not available in the consuming environment;
    this is handled by the pickling support and `to_dict/from_dict`.
