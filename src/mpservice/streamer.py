'''Process a data stream through I/O-bound operations with concurrency.

An input data stream goes through a series of operations.
The target use case is that one or more operations is I/O bound,
hence can benefit from concurrency via threading or asyncio.
These operations are called `transform`s.

The other operations are typically light weight and supportive
of the main (concurrent) operation. These operations perform batching,
unbatching, buffering, filtering, logging, etc.

===========
Basic usage
===========

In a typical use case, one starts with a `Streamer` object, places it under
context management, and calls its methods in a "chained" fashion:

    data = range(100)
    with Streamer(data) as stream:
        pipeline = (
            stream
            .batch(10)
            .transform(my_op_that_takes_a_batch, concurrency=4)
            .unbatch()
            )

The methods `batch`, `transform`, and `unbatch` (and some others)
all modify the object `stream` "in-place" and return the original object,
hence it's fine to add these operations one at a time,
and it's not necessary to assign the intermediate results to new identifiers.
The above is equivalent to the following:

    with Streamer(range(100)) as stream:
        stream.batch(10)
        stream.transform(my_op_that_takes_a_batch, concurrency=4)
        stream.unbatch()
        pipeline = stream

After this setup, there are several ways to use the object `stream`.

    1. Since `stream` is an Iterable and an Iterator, we can use it as such.
       Most naturally, iterate over it and process each element however
       we like.

       We can of couse also provide `stream` as a parameter where an iterable
       or iterator is expected. For example, the `mpservice.mpserver.Server`
       class has a method `stream` that expects an iterable, hence
       we can do things like

            server = Server(...)
            with server:
                for y in server.stream(stream):
                    ...
       Note that `server.stream(...)` does not produce a `Streamer` object.
       If we want to put it in subsequent operations, simply turn it into a
       `Streamer` object:

                pipeline = Streamer(server.stream(stream))
                pipeline.transform(yet_another_io_op)
                ...

    2. If the stream is not too long (not "big data"), we can convert it to
       a list by the method `collect`:

            result = stream.collect()

    3. If we don't need the elements coming out of `stream`, but rather
       just need the original data (`data`) to flow through all the operations
       of the pipeline (e.g. if the last "substantial" operation is inserting
       the data into a database), we can "drain" the stream:

            n = stream.drain()

       where the returned `n` is the number of elements coming out of the
       last operation in the pipeline.

    4. We can continue to add more operations to the pipeline, for example,

            stream.transform(another_op, concurrency=3)

Of all the methods on a Streamer instance, two will start new threads, namely
`.buffer()` and `.transform()`. In order to guarantee proper startup and shutdown
of the threads, these two methods require the Streamer object to be context-managed,
that is, within the `with` block:

    with Streamer(...) as streamer:
        streamer.buffer(...)
        streamer.transform(...)

The other methods do not start new threads, hence do not require context manager.
However, to reduce memory load, one may as well always enter the context manager
right upon the creation of a Streamer instance.


======================
Handling of exceptions
======================

There are two modes of exception handling.
In the first mode, exception propagates and, as it should, halts the program with
a printout of traceback. Any not-yet-processed data is discarded.

In the second mode, exception object is passed on in the pipeline as if it is
a regular data item. Subsequent data items are processed as usual.
This mode is enabled by `return_exceptions=True` to the function `transform`.
However, to the next operation, the exception object that is coming along
with regular data elements (i.e. regular output of the previous operation)
is most likely a problem. One may want to call `drop_exceptions` to remove
exception objects from the data stream before they reach the next operation.
In order to be knowledgeable about exceptions before they are removed,
the function `log_exceptions` can be used. Therefore, this is a useful pattern:

    (
        data_stream
        .transform(func1,..., return_exceptions=True)
        .log_exceptions()
        .drop_exceptions()
        .transform(func2,..., return_exceptions=True)
    )

Bear in mind that the first mode, with `return_exceptions=False` (the default),
is a totally legitimate and useful mode.

=====
Hooks
=====

There are several "hooks" that allow user to pass in custom functions to
perform operations tailored to their need. Check out the following functions:

    `drop_if`
    `keep_if`
    `peek`
    `transform`

Both `drop_if` and `keep_if` accept a function that evaluates a data element
and return a boolean value. Dependending on the return value, the element
is dropped from or kept in the data stream.

`peek` accepts a function that takes a data element and usually does
informational printing or logging (including persisting info to files).
This function may check conditions on the data element to decide whether
to do the printing or do nothing. (Usually we don't want to print for
every element; that would be overwhelming.)
This function is called for the side-effect;
it does not affect the flow of the data stream. The user-provided operator
should not modify the data element.

`transform` accepts a function that takes a data element, does something
about it, and returns a value. For example, modify the element and return
a new value, or call an external service with the data element as part of
the payload. Each input element will produce a new elment, becoming the
resultant stream. This method can not "drop" a data element (i.e do not
produce a result corresponding to an input element), neither can it produce
multiple results for a single input element (if it produces a list, say,
that list would be the result for the single input.)
If the operation is mainly for the side effect, e.g.
saving data in files or a database, hence there isn't much useful result,
then the result could be `None`, which is perfectly valid. Regardless,
the returned `None`s will still become the resultant stream.

# Iterable vs iterator
#
# if we need to use
#
#   for v in X:
#       ...
#
# then `X.__iter__()` is called to get an "iterator".
# In this case, `X` is an "iterable", and it must implement `__iter__`.
#
# If we do not use it that way, but rather only directly call
#
#   next(X)
#
# then `X` must implement `__next__` (but does not need to implement `__iter__`).
# This `X` is an "iterator".
#
# Often we let `__iter__` return `self`, and implement `__next__` in the same class.
# This way the class is both an iterable and an iterator.

# Async generator returns an async iterator.
