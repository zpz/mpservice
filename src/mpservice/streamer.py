"""
The module ``mpservice.streamer`` provides utilities for stream processing with threading or multiprocessing concurrencies.

An input data stream goes through a series of operations.
The output from one operation becomes the input to the next operation.
One or more "primary" operations are so heavy
that they can benefit from concurrency via threading
(if they are I/O bound) or multiprocessing (if they are CPU bound).
The other operations are typically light weight, although important in their own right.
These operations perform batching, unbatching, buffering, mapping, filtering, grouping, logging, etc.

# Iterable vs iterator
#
# if we need to use
#
#   for v in X:
#       ...
#
# then `X.__iter__()` is called to get an "iterator".
# In this case, `X` is an "iterable", and it must implement `__iter__`.
#
# If we do not use it that way, but rather only directly call
#
#   next(X)
#
# then `X` must implement `__next__` (but does not need to implement `__iter__`).
# This `X` is an "iterator".
#
# Often we let `__iter__` return `self`, and implement `__next__` in the same class.
# This way the class is both an iterable and an iterator.

# Async generator returns an async iterator.

            If ``None`` (the default), all exception objects are printed.

            To turn off the printouts by this condition, pass in ``()``.
            In that case, the value will still be printed according to the ``interval``
            condition, but the printout will not be tailored to the fact that

        stream is

        ::

            func(x, y, **kwargs)

        If ``initializer`` is not provided, then the first element is output as is, and "accumulation" begins
        with the second element. Suppose the input stream is ``x0``, ``x1``, ``x2``, ..., then the output
        stream is

        ::

            x0, func(x0, x1, **kwargs), func(func(x0, x1, **kwargs), x2), ...

        If ``initializer`` is provided (any user-provided value, including ``None``), then the first element
        of the output stream is

        ::

            func(initializer, x0, **kwargs)

        hence "accumulation" begins with the first element.

        .. note:: In some other languages or libraries, ``accumulate`` takes a stream or sequence and returns
            a single value as the result. This method, in contrast, returns a value for each element in the stream.
            In fact, the implementation is a simple application of :meth:`map`.

        """Parallel, or concurrent, counterpart of :meth:`map`.

        New threads or processes are created to execute ``func``.
        The function is applied on each element of the data stream and produces a new value,
        which forms the output stream.
        The entire input stream is *collectively* transformed by the multiple
        copies of ``func``.

        Elements in the output stream are in the order of the input elements.
        In other words, the order of data elements is preserved.

        The main difference between :meth:`parmap` and :meth:`map` is that the former
        creates a specified number of thread or processes to execute the function,
        whereas the latter executes a (simple) function in-line.

        Parameters
        ----------
        func
            A sync function that takes a single input item
            as the first positional argument and produces a result.
            Additional keyword args can be passed in via ``**kwargs``.

            The main point of ``func`` does not have to be its output.
            It could rather be some side effect. For example,
            saving data in a database. In that case, the output may be
            ``None``. Regardless, the output is yielded to be consumed by the next
            operator in the pipeline. A stream of ``None``\\s could be used
            in counting, for example.
        executor
            Either 'thread' or 'process'.
        concurrency
            Max number of threads (if ``executor='thread'``) or processes
            (if ``executor='process'``) created to run ``func``.
            This is also the max number of concurrent calls to ``func``
            that can be ongoing at any time.

            If ``None``, a default value is used depending on the value of ``executor``.
            If ``executor`` is ``'thread'``, as many as
            ``min(32, (os.cpu_count() or 1) + 4)`` threads are created.
            If ``executor`` is ``'process'``, as many as
            ``concurrency = os.cpu_count() or 1`` processes are created.
        return_x
            If ``True``, output stream will contain tuples ``(x, y)``;
            if ``False``, output stream will contain ``y`` only.
        return_exceptions
            If ``True``, exceptions raised by ``func`` will be
            in the output stream as if they were regular results; if ``False``,
            they will halt the operation and propagate.

            Note that a ``True`` value does not absorb exceptions
            raised by *previous* operators in the pipeline; it is concerned about
            exceptions raised by ``func`` only.
