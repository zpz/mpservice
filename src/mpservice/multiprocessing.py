"""
`multiprocessing`_ can be tricky.
``mpservice`` provides help to address several common difficulties.

First, it is a good idea to always use the non-default (on Linux) "spawn" method to start a process.
:data:`~mpservice.multiprocessing.MP_SPAWN_CTX` is provided to make this easier.

Second, in well structured code, a **spawned** process will not get the logging configurations that have been set
in the main process. On the other hand, we should definitely not separately configure logging in
non-main processes. The class :class:`~mpservice.multiprocessing.SpawnProcess` addresses this issue. In fact,
``MP_SPAWN_CTX.Process`` is a reference to ``SpawnProcess``. Therefore, when you use ``MP_SPAWN_CTX``,
logging in the non-main processes are covered---log messages are sent to the main process to be handled,
all transparently.

Third, one convenience of `concurrent.futures`_ compared to `multiprocessing`_ is that the former
makes it easy to get the results or exceptions of the child process via the object returned from job submission.
With `multiprocessing`_, in contrast, we have to pass the results or explicitly captured exceptions
to the main process via a queue. :class:`~mpservice.multiprocessing.SpawnProcess` has this covered as well.
It can be used in the ``concurrent.futures`` way.

Last but not least, if exception happens in a child process and we don't want the program to crash right there,
instead we send it to the main or another process to be investigated when/where we are ready to,
the traceback info will be lost in pickling. :class:`~mpservice.multiprocessing.RemoteException` helps on this.

class SpawnProcess(multiprocessing.context.SpawnProcess):
    """
    A subclass of the standard ``multiprocessing.context.SpawnProcess``,
    this customization adds two things:

    1. Make result and exception available as attributes of the
       process object, hence letting you use a ``SpawnProcess`` object
       similarly to how you use the ``Future`` object returned by
       `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor.submit <https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.Executor.submit>`_.
    2. Make logs in the worker process handled in the main process.

        Logging messages produced in worker processes are tricky.
        First, some settings should be concerned in the main process only,
        including log formatting, log-level control, log handler (destination), etc.
        Specifically, these should be settled in the "launching script", and definitely
        should not be concerned in worker processes.
        Second, the terminal printout of loggings in multiple processes tends to be
        intermingled and mis-ordered.

        This class uses a queue to transmit all logging messages that are produced
        in the worker process to the main process/thread, to be handled there.

    Examples
    --------
    Let's use an example to show the logging behavior.
    First, use a spawn-context from the standard `multiprocessing`_:

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        # log.py
        import logging
        import multiprocessing as mp
        from mpservice.multiprocessing import SpawnProcess


        def worker():
            logging.getLogger('worker.error').error('worker error')
            logging.getLogger('worker.warn').warning('worker warning')
            logging.getLogger('worker.info').info('worker info')
            logging.getLogger('worker.debug').debug('worker debug')


        def main():
            logging.getLogger('main.error').error('main error')
            logging.getLogger('main.info').info('main info')
            p = mp.get_context('spawn').Process(target=worker)
            p.start()
            p.join()
            logging.getLogger('main.warn').warning('main warning')
            logging.getLogger('main.debug').debug('main debug')


        if __name__ == '__main__':
            logging.basicConfig(
                format='[%(asctime)s.%(msecs)02d; %(levelname)s; %(name)s; %(funcName)s, %(lineno)d] [%(processName)s]  %(message)s',
                level=logging.DEBUG,
            )
            main()

    Run it::

        $ python log.py
        [2022-12-20 17:29:54,386.386; ERROR; main.error; main, 15] [MainProcess]  main error

        [2022-12-20 17:29:54,423.423; DEBUG; main.debug; main, 21] [MainProcess]  main debug

    Clearly, the child process exhibits the default behavior---print the warning-and-above-level log messages to the console---unaware of the logging configuration set in the main process.
    **This is a show stopper.**

    On line 15, replace ``mp.get_context('spawn').Process`` by ``SpawnProcess``.
    Run it again::

        $ python log.py
        [2022-12-20 17:39:31,284.284; ERROR; main.error; main, 15] [MainProcess]  main error

    This time, logs in the child process respect the level and format configurations set in the main process
    (because they are sent to and handled in the main process).

"""
`multiprocessing`_ has a "context", which has to do with how a process is created and started.
Multiprocessing objects like ``Process``, ``Queue``, ``Event``, etc., must be created from
the same context in order to work together. For example, if you send a ``Queue`` created out of
the "spawn" context to a ``Process`` created out of the "fork" context, it will not work.

Python's default "process start method" **on Linux** is "fork".
If you do

::

    import multiprocessing
    q = multiprocessing.Queue()

this is equivalent to

::

    q = multiprocessing.get_context().Queue()

`multiprocessing.get_context <https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.get_context>`_ takes the sole parameter ``method``,
which on Linux defaults to ``'fork'``.

However, it is advised to not use this default; rather, **always** use the "spawn" context.
There are some references on this topic; for example, see `this article <https://pythonspeed.com/articles/python-multiprocessing/>`_
and `this StackOverflow thread <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64095876/multiprocessing-fork-vs-spawn>`_.

So, multiprocessing code is often written this way::

    import multiprocessing
    ctx = multiprocessing.get_context('spawn')
    q = ctx.Queue(...)
    e = ctx.Event(...)
    p = ctx.Process(..., args=(q, e))
    ...

The constant ``MP_SPAWN_CTX`` is a replacement of the standard spawn context.
Instead of the above, you are advised to write this::

    from mpservice.multiprocessing import MP_SPAWN_CTX as ctx
    q = ctx.Queue(...)
    e = ctx.Event(...)
    p = ctx.Process(..., args=(q, e))
    ...

The difference between ``MP_SPAWN_CTX`` and the standard spawn context
is that ``MP_SPAWN_CTX.Process`` is the custom :class:`SpawnProcess` in place of the standard
`Process <https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Process>`_.

If you only need to start a process and don't need to create other objects
(like queue or event) from a context, then you can use :class:`SpawnProcess` directly.

All multiprocessing code in ``mpservice`` uses either ``MP_SPAWN_CTX``, or ``SpawnProcess`` directly.

`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor <https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor>`_
takes a parameter ``mp_context``.
You can provide ``MP_SPAWN_CTX`` for this parameter so that the executor will use ``SpawnProcess``.
"""


# ``MP_SPAWN_CTX.Manager`` does not use this class.
class ServerProcess(multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager):

    """A "server process" provides a server running in one process,
    to be called from other processes for shared data or functionalities.

    The class ``ServerProcess`` is based on ``Manager`` in the standard ``multiprocessing``,
    but is specifically for the use case where user needs to design and register a custom class
    to be used in a "server process". The API of ``ServerProcess`` may continue to diverge
    from that of ``Manager``.

    If you don't need a custom class, but rather just need to use one of the standard classes,
    for example, ``Event``, you may prefer to use that via ``MP_SPAWN_CTX.Manager``.

    The basic workflow is as follows.

    1. Register one or more classes with the :class:`ServerProcess` class::

            class Doubler:
                def __init__(self, ...):
                    ...

                def double(self, x):
                    return x * 2

            class Tripler:
                def __init__(self, ...):
                    ...

                def triple(self, x):
                    return x * 3

            ServerProcess.register(Doubler)
            ServerProcess.register(Tripler)

    2. Create a manager object and start it::

            server = ServerProcess()
            server.start()

    A preferred way is to use a context manager::

            with ServerProcess() as server:
                ...

    3. Create one or more proxies::

            doubler = server.Doubler(...)
            tripler = server.Tripler(...)

    The above causes corresponding class objects to be created
    in the server process; the returned objects are "proxies"
    for the real objects. These proxies can be passed to any other
    processes and used there.

    The arguments in the above calls are passed to the server process
    and used in the ``__init__`` methods of the corresponding classes.
    For this reason, the parameters to ``__init__`` of a registered class
    must all be pickle-able.

    Calling one registered class multiple times, like

    ::

            prox1 = server.Doubler(...)
            prox2 = server.Doubler(...)

    will create independent objects in the server process.

    Multiple ServerProcess objects will run their corresponding
    server processes independently.

    4. Pass the proxy objects to any process and use them there.

    Public methods (minus "properties") defined by the registered classes
    can be invoked on a proxy with the same parameters and get the expected
    result. For example,

    ::

            prox1.double(3)

    will return 6. Inputs and output of the public method
    should all be pickle-able.
