`multiprocessing`_ can be tricky.
``mpservice`` provides help to address several common difficulties.

First, it is a good idea to always use the non-default (on Linux) "spawn" method to start a process.
:data:`~mpservice.multiprocessing.MP_SPAWN_CTX` is provided to make this easier.

Second, in well structured code, a **spawned** process will not get the logging configurations that have been set
in the main process. On the other hand, we should definitely not separately configure logging in
non-main processes. The class :class:`~mpservice.multiprocessing.SpawnProcess` addresses this issue. In fact,
``MP_SPAWN_CTX.Process`` is a reference to ``SpawnProcess``. Therefore, when you use ``MP_SPAWN_CTX``,
logging in the non-main processes are covered---log messages are sent to the main process to be handled,
all transparently.

Third, one convenience of `concurrent.futures`_ compared to `multiprocessing`_ is that the former
makes it easy to get the results or exceptions of the child process via the object returned from job submission.
With `multiprocessing`_, in contrast, we have to pass the results or explicitly captured exceptions
to the main process via a queue. :class:`~mpservice.multiprocessing.SpawnProcess` has this covered as well.
It can be used in the ``concurrent.futures`` way.

Last but not least, if exception happens in a child process and we don't want the program to crash right there,
instead we send it to the main or another process to be investigated when/where we are ready to,
the traceback info will be lost in pickling. :class:`~mpservice.multiprocessing.RemoteException` helps on this.

# Names like `Process`, `Queue`, `Pool`, `Event`, `Manager` etc are directly import-able from this module.
# But they are not classes; rather they are bound methods of the context `MP_SPAWN_CTX`.
# This is the same behavior as the standard `multiprocessing`.
# With this, you can usually replace
