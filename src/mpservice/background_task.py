        This method contains the operations of the user task.
        It runs in `self._executor`.

        In order to make sure these operations do not keep state
        in an instance of this class, it is a `classmethod`.

        Subclass implementation may want to make the parameter listing
        more specific.

        The parameters `_cancelled` and `_info` are provided by
        the background-task mechanism rather than the user task itself,
        but are to be used by the user task.

        If the task tends to take long, and wants to support cancellation,
        then it should check `_cancelled.is_set()` periodically (preferrably
        rather frequently), and stops if the flag is set.
        Note that `concurrent.futures.Future.cancel`
        can only cancel the execution of a scheduled task if it has not started
        running yet. Once the task is ongoing, `Future.cancel` can't stop
        the execution. Therefore user code needs to be proactive, using
        `_cancelled` to detect the cancellation request and act accordingly.

        The queue `_info` is used to pass info to the caller, e.g. periodic
        progress reports. Because there is no guarantee that this queue
        is being checked by the caller timely or at all,
        we can't let it have unlimited capacity and keep elements in it.
        In fact, it has length 1. Before pushing an element onto
        the queue, the user code should pop any existing elements.
        An element in this queue is typically a small dict.

        It is not mandatory that the user task code makes use of
        `_cancelled` and `_info`.

        Determine an ID for the task based on the input parameters.
        Next time when a task is submitted, if its task ID
        turns out to be identical to an in-progress task,
        it will not be re-submitted; rather, it will just
        wait for the result of the in-progress task.

        There are some caveats in determination of this task ID.
        For example, if one of the input parameter is a large list,
        do we use the full content of the list to determine the ID?

        For another example, if the task takes the path of an input
        file, and the path is hard-coded and never changes, then
        this parameter value never changes; but does this mean
        the content of the file does not change?
        If we assume the file content could change anytime,
        we may consider each submission to constitute a unique task.
        Then, simply return a random task ID.

        The parameter list should be identical to that
        of `run`, minus `_cancelled` and `_status`.
