"""
``mpservice.mpserver`` provides classes that use `multiprocessing`_ to perform CPU-bound operations
taking advantage of all the CPUs (i.e. cores) on the machine.

Using `threading`_ to perform IO-bound operations is also supported, although that is not the initial focus.

There are three levels of constructs.

1. On the lowest level is :class:`Worker`. This defines operations on a single input item
   or a batch of items in usual sync code. This is supposed to run in its own process (thread)
   and use that single process (thread) only.

2. On the middle level is :class:`Servlet`. A basic form of Servlet arranges to execute a :class:`Worker` in multiple
   processes (threads). A more "advanced" form of Servlet arranges to executive multiple
   Servlets as a sequence or an ensemble.

3. On the top level is :class:`Server`. A Server
   handles interfacing with the outside world, while passing the "real work" to
   a :class:`Servlet` and relays the latter's result to the requester.

        The main concern here is to set up controls for "batching" via
        the two parameters ``batch_size`` and ``batch_wait_time``.

        If the algorithm can not vectorize the computation, then there is
        no advantage in enabling batching. In that case, the subclass should
        simply fix ``batch_size`` to 0 in their ``__init__`` and invoke
        ``super().__init__`` accordingly.

        The ``__init__`` of a subclass may define additional input parameters;
        they can be passed in through :meth:`run`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        batch_size
            Max batch size; see :meth:`call`.

            Remember to pass in ``batch_size`` in accordance with the implementation
            of :meth:`call`. In other words, if ``batch_size > 0``, then :meth:`call`
            must handle a list input that contains a batch of elements.
            On the other hand, if ``batch_size`` is 0, then the input to :meth:`call`
            is a single element.

            If ``None``, then 0 is used, meaning no batching.

            If ``batch_size=1``, then processing is batched in form without
            speed benefits of batching.
        batch_wait_time
            Seconds, may be 0; the total duration
            to wait for one batch after the first item has arrived.

            For example, suppose ``batch_size`` is 100 and ``batch_wait_time`` is 1.
            After the first item has arrived, if at least 99 items arrive within 1 second,
            then a batch of 100 elements will be produced;
            if less than 99 elements arrive within 1 second, then the wait will stop
            at 1 second, hence a batch of less than 100 elements will be produced;
            the batch could have only one element.

            If 0, then there's no wait. After the first element is obtained,
            if there are more elements in ``q_in`` "right there right now",
            they will be retrieved until a batch of ``batch_size`` elements is produced.
            Any moment when ``q_in`` is empty, the collection will stop,
            and the elements collected so far (less than ``batch_size`` count of them)
            will make a batch.
            In other words, batching happens only for items that are already
            "piled up" in ``q_in`` at the moment.

            To leverage batching, it is recommended to set ``batch_wait_time``
            to a small positive value. Small, so that there is not much futile waiting.
            Positive (as opposed to 0), so that it always waits a little bit
            just in case more elements are coming in.

            When ``batch_wait_time > 0``, it will hurt performance during
            sequential calls (i.e. send a request with a single element, wait for the result,
            then send the next, and so on), because this worker will always
            wait for this long for additional items to come and form a batch,
            yet additional items will never come during sequential calls.
            However, when batching is enabled, sequential calls are not
            the intended use case. Beware of this factor in benchmarking.

            If ``batch_size`` is 0 or 1, then ``batch_wait_time`` should be left unspecified,
            otherwise the only valid value is 0.

            If ``batch_size > 1``, then ``batch_wait_time`` is 0.01 by default.
        batch_size_log_cadence
            Log batch size statistics every this many batches. If ``None``, this log is turned off.

            This log is for debugging and development purposes.

            This is ignored if ``batch_size=0``.

        collect the outputs of :meth:`call`,  and put them in the output queue.

        If ``self.batch_size == 0``, then ``x`` is a single
        element, and this method returns result for ``x``.

        If ``self.batch_size > 0`` (including 1), then
        ``x`` is a list of input data elements, and this
        method returns a list (or `Sequence`_) of results corresponding
        to the elements in ``x``.
        However, this output, when received by private methods of this class,

        correspond to the elements in the input queue (``q_in``),
        although *vectorized* computation, or *batching*, has happended internally.

        When batching is enabled (i.e. when ``self.batch_size > 0``), the number of
        elements in ``x`` varies between calls depending on the supply
        in the input queue. The list ``x`` does not have a fixed length.

        Be sure to distinguish batching from the non-batching case where a single
        input is naturally a list. In that case, the output of
        the this method is the result corresponding to the single input ``x``.
        The result could be anything---it may or may not be a list.

        0 or nonzero, make sure this method is implemented accordingly.

        cpus
            Specifies how many processes to create and how they are pinned
            to specific CPUs.

            The default is ``None``, indicating a single unpinned process.

            Otherwise, a list of :class:`CpuAffinity` objects.
            For convenience, values of primitive types are also accepted;
            they will be used to construct `CpuAffinity` objects.
            The number of processes created is the number of elements in ``cpus``.
            The CPU spec is very flexible. For example,

            ::

                cpus=[[0, 1, 2], [0], [2, 3], [4, 5, 6], 4, None]

            This instructs the servlet to create 6 processes, each running an instance
            of ``worker_cls``. The CPU affinity of each process is as follows:

            1. CPUs 0, 1, 2
            2. CPU 0
            3. CPUs 2, 3
            4. CPUs 4, 5, 6
            5. CPU 4
            6. Any CPU, no pinning
        name
            The main part of the names of the worker processes.
            If not specified, the name of this class is used.
            Each process is named after this value plus its CPU affinity info.

        When this is called, this server is usually backing a (http or other) service.
        Concurrent async calls to this object may happen.
        In such use cases, :meth:`call` and :meth:`stream` should not be called to this object
        at the same time.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x
            Input data element.
        timeout
            In seconds. If result is not ready after this time, :class:`~mpservice.util.TimeoutError` is raised.

            There are two situations where timeout happens.
            At first, ``x`` is placed in an input queue for processing.
            This step is called "enqueue".
            If the queue is full for the moment, the code will wait.
            If a spot does not become available during the ``timeout`` period,
            the :class:`~mpservice.util.TimeoutError` message will be "... seconds enqueue".

            Once ``x`` is placed in the input queue, code will wait for the result at the end
            of an output queue. If result is not yet ready when the ``timeout`` period
            is over, the :class:`~mpservice.util.TimeoutError` message will be ".. seconds total".
            This wait, as well as the error message, includes the time that has been spent
            in the "enqueue" step, that is, the timer starts upon receiving the request.
        backpressure
            If ``True``, and the input queue is full, do not wait; raise :class:`ServerBacklogFull`
            right away. If ``False``, wait on the input queue for as long as
            ``timeout`` seconds. Effectively, the input queue is considered full if
            there are ``backlog`` count of ongoing (i.e. received but not yet returned) requests
            in the server, where ``backlog`` is a parameter to :meth:`__init__`.

        Use this method for high-throughput processing of a long stream of
        data elements. In theory, this method achieves the throughput upper-bound
        of the server, as it saturates the pipeline.

        The order of elements in the stream is preserved, i.e.,
        elements in the output stream corresponds to elements
        in the input stream in the same order.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data_stream
            An iterable, possibly unlimited, of input data elements.
        return_x
            If ``True``, each output element is a length-two tuple
            containing the input data and the result.
            If ``False``, each output element is just the result.
        return_exceptions
            If ``True``, any Exception object will be produced in the output stream
            in place of the would-be regular result.
            If ``False``, exceptions will be propagated right away, crashing the program.
        timeout
            Interpreted the same as in :meth:`call` and :meth:`async_call`.

            In a streaming task, "timeout" is usually not a concern compared
            to overall throughput. You can usually leave it at the default value.
