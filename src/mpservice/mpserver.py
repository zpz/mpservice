"""Service using multiprocessing to perform CPU-bound operations
making use of multiple CPUs (i.e. cores) on the machine.

There are 4 levels of constructs.

- On the lowest level is `Worker`. This defines operation on a single input item
  or a batch of items in usual sync code. This is supposed to run in a separate process
  and uses that single process only. (If the code futher creates other processes,
  well, no one can forbid that, but that is not the intended usage.)

  There are two worker classes: `ProcessWorker` and `ThreadWorker`.

- A `Servlet` manages a `Worker`, specifing how many processes are to be created,
  each executing the worker code independently. It may control exactly
  which CPU(s) each worker process uses. The servlet code runs in the "main process",
  whereas workers run in other processes. Each input item is processed by one
  and only one worker.

  There are two servelet classess: `ProcessServlet` and `ThreadServlet`.

  If `W1` is a subclass of `ProcessWorker`, then the simplest servlet
  is like this:

    s = ProcessServlet(W1)

  This creates one worker process that is not pinned to a particular CPU.

- Servlets can be composed in `Sequential`s or `Ensemble`s. In a `Sequential`,
  the first servlet's output becomes the second servlet's input, and so on.
  In an `Ensemble`, each input item is processed by all the servlets, and their
  results are collected in a list.

  Great power comes from the fact that both `Sequential` and `Ensemble`
  also follow the `Servlet` API, hence both can be constituents of other compositions.
  In principle, you can freely compose and nest them.
  For example, suppose `W1`, `W2`,..., are `Worker` subclasses,
  then you may design such a workflow,

    s = Sequential(
            ProcessServlet(W1),
            Ensemble(
                ThreadServlet(W2),
                Sequential(ProcessServlet(W3), ThreadServlet(W4)),
                ),
            Ensemble(
                Sequetial(ProcessServlet(W5), ProcessServlet(W6)),
                Sequetial(ProcessServlet(W7), ThreadServlet(W8), ProcessServlet(W9)),
                ),
        )

  In sum, `ProcessServlet`, `ThreadServlet`, `Sequential`, `Ensemble` are collectively
  referred to and used as `Servlet`.

- On the top level is `Server`. Pass a `Servlet`, or `Sequential` or `Ensemble`
  into a `Server`, which handles scheduling as well as interfacing with the outside
  world:

    server = Server(s)
    with server:
        y = server.call(38)
        z = await server.async_call('abc')

        for x, y in server.stream(data, return_x=True):
            print(x, y)

The "interface" and "scheduling" code of `Server` runs in the "main process".
Two usage patterns are supported, namely making (concurrent) individual
calls to the service to get individual results, or flowing
a potentially unlimited stream of data through the service
to get a stream of results. The first usage supports a sync API and an async API.

The user's main work is implementing the operations in the "workers".
Another task (of some trial and error) by the user is experimenting with
CPU allocations among workers to achieve best performance.

Code in the "workers" should raise exceptions as it normally does, without handling them,
if it considers the situation to be non-recoverable, e.g. input is of wrong type.
The exceptions will be funneled through the pipelines and raised to the end-user
with useful traceback info.

        `batch_wait_time`: seconds, may be 0; the total duration

        `batch_size_log_cadence`: log batch size statistics every this
            many batches. If `None`, do not log.

        To leverage batching, it is recommended to set `batch_wait_time`
        to a small positive value. If it is 0, worker will never wait
        when another item is not already there in the pipeline;
        in other words, batching happens only for items that are already
        "piled up" at the moment.

        When `batch_wait_time > 0`, it will hurt performance during
        sequential calls to the service, because worker will always
        wait for this long for additional items to come and form a batch,
        while additional item will never come during sequential use.
        However, when batching is enabled, sequential calls are not
        the intended use case. Beware of this in benchmarking.

        Remember to pass in `batch_size` in accordance with the implementation
        of `call`.

        If the algorithm can not vectorize the computation, then there is
        no advantage in enabling batching. In that case, the subclass should
        simply fix `batch_size` to 0 in their `__init__`.

        The `__init__` of a subclass may define additional input parameters;
        they can be passed in through `run`.

        element, and this method returns result for `x`.

        If `self.batch_size > 0` (including 1), then
        `x` is a list of input data elements, and this
        method returns a list of results corresponding
        to the elements in `x`.
        However, the service (see near the end of `_start_batch`)
        will split the resultant list
        into single results for individual elements of `x`.
        This is *vectorized* computation, or *batching*,
        handled by this service pipeline.

        When batching is enabled, the number of
        elements in `x` varies between calls depending on the supply
        of data. The list `x` does not have a fixed length.

        Be sure to distinguish this from the case where a single
        input is naturally a list. In that case, the output of
        the current method is the result corresponding to
        the single input `x`. The result could be anything---it
        may or may not be a list.

        If a subclass fixes `batch_size` in its `__init__` to be
        0 or nonzero, make sure the current method is implemented
        accordingly. If `__init__` has no requirement on the value
        of `batch_size`, then the current method needs to check
        `self.batch_size` and act accordingly, because it is up to
        the uer in `Servlet` to specify a zero or nonzero `batch_size`
        for this worker.

        In case of exceptions, unless the user has specific things to do,
